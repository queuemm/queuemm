- 👋 Hi, I’m @queuemm
- 👀 I’m interested in GNU/Linux, Magic: the Gathering, libertarian socialism, flags, maps, hypnosis, the human psyche and condition. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning no programing languages aside from what I need to for dotfiles and bash/zsh scripts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever.
- 📫 How to reach me: Nah.
